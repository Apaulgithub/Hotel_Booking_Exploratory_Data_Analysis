# Hotel_Booking_Analysis_EDA_Project

The purpose of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of hotel bookings. The dataset contains information on bookings made at two hotels(City Hotel & Resort Hotel) over a period of time.
The goal of the EDA is to gain insights into the data and answer questions such as:
What are the most popular months for bookings? How long do guests typically stay? What factors are most strongly associated with cancellations? Are there any patterns in the data that suggest certain types of guests are more likely to booking most of the time? The EDA will begin with a data cleaning process, where missing or erroneous data will be identified and addressed. The data will then be explored through a variety of visualizations, including scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps, to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
The final deliverables for this project will include a report summarizing the findings, as well as visualizations and code used in the EDA. This report will be useful for stakeholders such as hotel managers, who can use the insights gained to improve their operations and make data-driven decisions.
